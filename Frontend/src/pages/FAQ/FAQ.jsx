                    <p>A: We believe in change. Our goal is to make life better for people who are either street homeless or on the brink of it. We firmly believe that change is possible, and we are here to make it happen, but we cannot do it alone. When you donate to Nottingham Street Aid, you are providing hope. Your contributions go towards grants that directly impact the lives of rough sleepers, helping with practical needs like transportation, housing deposits, and training resources.</p>
